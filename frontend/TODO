CHAT 

ADD EMOJI FEATURES

Try and open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox), log in with different users that are not following each other at all. Then with one of the users try to send a private message to the other user.
Can you confirm that it was not possible to create a chat between these two users?

Using the three browsers with the users, enter with each user a common group. Then start sending messages to the common chat room using one of the users.
